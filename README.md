# Wiki Modern
Wiki Modern is a Wikipedia inspired theme for your WordPress site. The development of Wiki Modern started with two humble goals in mind:

1. A hobby project to teach myself WordPress development.
2. Motivation to redesign my business website: [Caboodle Tech](https://caboodle.tech/).<br>( Go from a single page site to WordPress backed tech blog )

Of the original goals I am proud to say that I have successfully accomplished 1.25 of those goals:

1. :heavy_check_mark: A hobby project to teach myself WordPress development.
2. :heavy_minus_sign: ~Motivation to~ redesign my business website: [Caboodle Tech](https://caboodle.tech/).<br>( Go from a single page site to WordPress backed ~tech blog~ [abandonment] )

# Features
Wiki Modern is full of modern features like:

- Flex layout.
- Responsive images via [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).
- Fully customizable via WordPress's Customizer:
   - Massive amount of widget areas.
   - Alter every color on the page from text to backgrounds.
- SEO focused.
- Reading mode on post pages.
- Customizable page print on every page or post.
   - Show / hide images.
   - Show / hide media (video & audio).
   - Show / hide forms.
   - QR code for quick digital access to the printed post or page.

The biggest feature for me personally is the Reading Mode and QR Code on Print. I got hired as an Adjunct Professor when I first started developing Wiki Modern and I envisaged my students using the site a lot. I imagined students would like to print out articles and tutorials for their records and with the QR code they could easily return to the post in the future to check for updates or to share the article with others.

# Wiki Modern's Future
I love Wiki Modern and I will for the time being always support it. However, if my business website is any indication of the spare time I have on my hands, this will continue to be a spare time endeavor. :zzz::zzz::tired_face::zzz::zzz: In all seriousness I believe most work on Wiki Modern has been done late at night after work or on my Saturdays and I do not see myself having the time to change that schedule. My students, ~clients~, and employer(s) come first.
